<h1>Offboarding users</h1>

<p>The nice thing about having an IdP is that offboarding users from your Substrate-managed AWS organization doesn&rsquo;t have to involve a single additional step - just deactivate the users in your IdP and go on about your day.</p>

<p>There are, however, a couple of things you might want to do to tidy up after someone leaves and loses access to AWS.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look for and (probably) terminate EC2 instances they provisioned from the Instance Factory by their email address: <code>xargs -I"<strong><em>" aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=key-name,Values=<em>email-address</em>" --region "</em></strong>" &lt;"substrate.regions"</code></li>
<li>Talk to their teammates to ensure all the infrastructure they were managing is owned and accounted for</li>
<li>Rotate secrets they may have had access to and which may be used from the public Internet e.g. GitHub API tokens, IAM user access keys for integrations that don&rsquo;t support IAM roles</li>
</ol>
