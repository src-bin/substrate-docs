<h1>Regaining access if Credential and Instance Factories are broken</h1>

<p>If for some reason your Credential and Instance Factories are both broken, which could in fact be because the API Gateway authenticator and/or authorizer that ties them to your identity provider are broken, you&rsquo;ll find yourself feeling pretty locked out.</p>

<p>If you happen to have credentials in your shell environment that are still valid, you can run <code>substrate-create-admin-account</code> to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>More likely, though, you&rsquo;ll need to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to the AWS Console via your identity provider (or, in extreme situations, login to your AWS organization&rsquo;s management account directly and skip to step 3)</li>
<li>Assume the <code>OrganizationAdministrator</code> role in your management account (using the information in <code>substrate.accounts.txt</code> as your guide)</li>
<li>Visit <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users/OrganizationAdministrator?section=security_credentials">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users/OrganizationAdministrator?section=security_credentials</a></li>
<li>Click <strong>Create access key</strong></li>
<li>Provide the resulting access key ID and secret access key to <code>substrate-create-admin-account</code></li>
<li>When your Credential and Instance Factories return to service, delete the access key you created in step 4</li>
</ol>
