<h1>Recommended SOC 2 controls</h1>

<p>Most Substrate users are already or soon will be operating a SOC 2 compliance program. This page documents the many SOC 2 criteria that are at least partially addressed merely by adopting Substrate. In some cases, reference controls are provided that you&rsquo;re free to adopt verbatim.</p>

<p>CC2.1, CC4.1 use the Auditor role to enable infrastructure-level vulnerability scanning and penetration testing</p>

<p>CC2.2, CC2.3 system boundaries (and internal partitions) as AWS accounts, mapped in <code>substrate.accounts.txt</code></p>

<p>CC2.2, CC7.3 TODO publish a sample incident response plan like J&rsquo;s</p>

<p>CC3.2 to the degree that changes are risky, Substrate helps to minimize the blast radius of changes in service (especially) of availability</p>

<p>CC4.1 AWS access is brokered entirely by the IdP, which reduces the number of places where access must be granted, revoked, and reviewed</p>

<p>CC5.1 multiple AWS accounts severely limit risks between domains, between environments, of over-permissioning, and of confused deputies</p>

<p>CC6.1 IdP and IAM roles, 2FA or temporary credentials, segmentation of networks and AWS accounts, TLS or SSH for everything</p>

<p>CC6.2, CC6.3 IdP and IAM roles</p>

<p>CC6.4 no physical access to AWS so scope&rsquo;s reduced to laptops, mobile phones, and offices</p>

<p>CC6.6 IdP brokers all access from the outside, encrypted by TLS and SSH, firewall defaults to closed</p>

<p>CC6.7 IdP brokers all access</p>

<p>CC6.8, CC7.1 Terraform code under version control and mandatory code review governs everything that runs in AWS</p>

<p>CC7.1 TODO is there a scanner we can cost-effectively enable by default?</p>

<p>CC7.2 CloudTrail TODO what alerts should we configure by default? (also note that they need their own monitoring for availability)</p>

<p>CC8.1 having multiple AWS accounts enables (safe) testing and controlled implementation of all kinds of changes, environments separate development, staging, production, etc.</p>

<p>CC9.1 infrastructure can be (somewhat) easily rebuilt in a different AWS region, Substrate makes active use of multiple regions a bit easier than otherwise</p>

<p>CC9.1 IdP disaster can be averted by using the management account and (optionally) configuring a different IdP</p>

<p>A1.1 elastic nature of almost all AWS products makes this trivial, minimizing active capacity management burdens</p>

<p>A1.2 multiple availability zones and/or regions</p>

<p>A1.3 native use of environments and multiple regions can streamline disaster recovery exercises</p>
