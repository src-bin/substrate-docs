<h1>Upgrading Substrate</h1>

<p>In general, upgrading Substrate is a matter of replacing the Substrate binaries and re-running certain of the bootstrapping and account creation commands. The most thorough upgrade requires that you run the following after replacing the binaries:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>substrate-bootstrap-management-account</code></li>
<li><code>substrate-bootstrap-network-account</code></li>
<li><code>substrate-bootstrap-deploy-account</code></li>
<li><code>substrate-create-admin-account</code> for each of your admin accounts</li>
<li><code>substrate-create-account</code> for each of your other accounts</li>
</ol>

<p>Release notes will endeavor to call out specific of these steps that are necessary to gain access to new features. Others remain recommended, of course.</p>

<p>Upgrade compatibility is only guaranteed from one month to the next so it&rsquo;s important to stay up-to-date. Behavior of upgrading several versions in one step is undefined and may not function properly.</p>

<h2>Upgrade notes by release</h2>

<p>See the <a href="/substrate/manual/releases/">release notes</a> for version-specific upgrade notes for versions 2021.02 and beyond.</p>

<h3>2021.01</h3>

<p>You must run <code>substrate-create-admin-account</code> for each of your admin accounts before you&rsquo;ll be able to use <code>eval $(substrate-credentials)</code> to streamline your use of the Credential Factory.</p>

<h3>2020.12</h3>

<p>You must run <code>substrate-bootstrap-management-account</code> in order to re-tag your former master account as your management account. (This rename follows AWS&rsquo; own renaming.)</p>
